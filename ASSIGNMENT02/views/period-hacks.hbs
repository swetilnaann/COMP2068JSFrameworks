        <p class="lead mb-3">
          Your body does so much every month. You don’t have to “push through” everything alone —
          you’re allowed to rest, adjust, and be kind to yourself.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-2">
          These ideas are meant to help you feel a little more comfortable and confident during each part
          of your cycle. They’re general suggestions, not medical advice. If your pain or bleeding feels
          unusual or severe, it’s always a smart idea to talk to a health professional.

          You are not “too emotional”, “too lazy”, or “too much”. You’re a human being with hormones doing
          real work in the background. 💗

        <h3 class="mb-3">🩸 Menstrual Phase – Gentle & Soft Days</h3>
        <p class="text-muted">
          When your period arrives, your body is doing a lot. Cramps, tiredness, and heavier emotions are all
          completely valid. This phase is your reminder that slowing down is not “failing” — it’s caring.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Create a “period nest”.</strong> Set up a comfy corner with your favourite blanket,
            soft clothes, a water bottle, and maybe a book or show. Knowing you have a safe cozy spot waiting
            can make the day feel less overwhelming.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Warmth = comfort.</strong> A warm water bottle or heating pad on your lower belly or back
            can ease cramps. Always wrap it in a cloth so it isn’t too hot on your skin.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Tiny movements count.</strong> If you’re up for it, try slow stretching in bed,
            gentle yoga, or a short walk around your room. You don’t have to “work out” — just help your muscles
            unclench.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Kind food choices, not perfect ones.</strong> Warm, simple meals like soup, rice,
            toast, or oatmeal can feel soothing. If you crave chocolate or snacks, enjoying some without guilt
            is also a form of self-care.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Make a mini checklist.</strong> On heavy days, even small tasks can feel huge.
            Create a short list like “drink water, eat something, take meds if needed, shower if possible”.
            Checking off even one is a win.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Rest without apology.</strong> You don’t have to be productive every single day.
            Listening to your body now often helps you feel stronger later in the cycle.

        <h3 class="mb-3">🌱 Follicular Phase – Recharge & Rebuild</h3>
        <p class="text-muted">
          After your period ends, many people feel their energy gently climb back up. This is a good time to
          reset, re-organize, and slowly lean into the things that matter to you.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Light goal reset.</strong> Instead of huge goals, pick 2–3 small things you’d like
            to focus on this cycle: “walk a bit more”, “sleep a bit earlier”, “keep my room slightly tidier”.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Move in ways you enjoy.</strong> Use this phase to reintroduce movement that feels fun:
            dancing in your room, walking with music or a podcast, swimming, or whatever makes you feel alive,
            not punished.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Colorful plate hack.</strong> Aim for meals with different colours (greens, oranges, reds,
            browns). This naturally bumps up vitamins and minerals without strict dieting.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Gentle habit stacking.</strong> Attach a tiny habit to something you already do:
            “After brushing my teeth, I’ll drink a glass of water” or “After opening my laptop, I’ll stretch
            for 30 seconds.”
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Cycle journaling.</strong> Write a few lines about how you feel in this phase:
            energy, mood, focus. Over time, you might spot patterns that help you plan your month better.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Plan for future-you.</strong> Use your tracker to estimate your next period so you can
            avoid scheduling big events or long trips on your heaviest days if possible.

        <h3 class="mb-3">💧 Ovulation Phase – Confidence & Connection</h3>
        <p class="text-muted">
          Around the middle of the cycle, some people feel more social, confident, or energetic. Others don’t notice
          much at all — both are normal. If you do feel a boost, you can gently use it to your advantage.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>“Brave tasks” window.</strong> If you need to present, ask for help, apply for a job,
            or have a difficult conversation, this might be the phase where you feel a little braver.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Celebrate your body.</strong> You don’t have to look a certain way to appreciate yourself.
            Wear an outfit that makes you feel comfortable and confident, even if it’s just your favourite hoodie.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Connect with people who lift you up.</strong> Use any extra social energy on people
            who make you feel safe and seen, not drained.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Balanced planning.</strong> Even with higher energy, leave spaces in your schedule
            to breathe so you don’t feel overwhelmed in the next phase.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Check in with your needs.</strong> Ask yourself: “What’s one thing I can do this week
            that future-me will be grateful for?” It might be cleaning your space, organizing notes, or booking
            an appointment.

        <h3 class="mb-3">🌙 Luteal Phase – PMS & Pre-Period Kindness</h3>
        <p class="text-muted">
          This is the “pre-period” phase. Mood swings, irritation, bloating, and tiredness can feel louder here.
          It doesn’t mean you’re dramatic — your hormones are genuinely shifting.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Lower-pressure planning.</strong> Try not to stack this time with too many social events
            or major deadlines if you can avoid it. Leave room for evenings where you can just rest.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Kind inner voice practice.</strong> When your brain says “I’m failing at everything”,
            gently answer: “I’m overwhelmed right now. I’m allowed to rest and I’ll try again later.”
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Bloating comfort kit.</strong> Comfy stretchy clothes, warm drinks, and lying down with
            your legs slightly elevated can feel soothing when your body feels heavy or puffy.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Feel your feelings safely.</strong> Music, drawing, journaling, or talking to someone
            you trust can help big emotions move through instead of getting stuck.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Sleep is powerful.</strong> Even 20–30 minutes of earlier bedtime can help your mood
            and reduce that “everything is too much” feeling during this phase.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Ask for help when you need it.</strong> If PMS makes school, work, or relationships
            really hard, it’s completely valid to talk to a doctor or counsellor. Needing help doesn’t make you weak.
          </li>
        </ul>
